Apple's EULA and Google's TOC appear reasonable seen through the lens of today's political and legislative climate. Unfortunately, the documents (these types of documents in general) are unreadable and draconian. Unreadability leads to an opaque, closed world for users and providers. Rather than adopting "lock and key"-as-a-service (LKAAS), these providers ought consider their services as public goods; and users ought to be utilizing tools to own and manage these services independently [1]. It is unreasonable that Google sells an unwitting customer's e-mails to advertisers, given Google's monopoly status and e-mail as a public good.

Similarly, software licensing is presently a necessary evil. Users are chastised for "looking under the hood." "Taking the owner's word," users are dumbed-down and left beholden to the pittance of large enterprises, who create black-boxes out of uncomplicated code and algorithms that users do not even begin to comprehend. By now users ought to be distinctly knowledgeable of systems and software. With collaboration and public good in mind, providers ought to be fighting over the customers who seize the moment to glimpse deeper (free eyes-on-the-code; code-bases without users are worthless) rather than pretending to give a damn all the while keeping consumers locked away in the dark age of unknowledge.

Rather than buildings fortresses, users ought to be supporting enterprises pursuing the public good.
